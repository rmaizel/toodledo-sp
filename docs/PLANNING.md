# ToodleDo-SP Planning

Rapid planning of how to create the ToodleDo-SP plugin.

## Purpose & Constraints

This plugin is intended to do the following:

- Allow someone to use Super Productivity ("SP") as the desktop application for ToodleDo.
- Import all tasks and fields from ToodleDo into SP.
- Synchronize changed tasks from SP back to ToodleDo online.
- Support importing ToodleDo tasks from a file for one-time migration.

## Vision of Success

When the plugin is complete, it can be added to the Super Productivity app - imported from a Plugin file - and will be synchronized with any SP backups.

It will be configurable from within the application to connect to the user's ToodleDo account online - storing appropriate keys, etc. - using the Developer API for ToodleDo to be able to synchronize tasks.
